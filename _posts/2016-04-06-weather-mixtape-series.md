'Where I Go When They Talk About The Weather' is a series of DJ mixes I started back in August of 2015\. It was inspired when a friend ask me what I would think about when people were using small talk as a way of avoiding deeper connective conversations. Upon reflection I realized I often thought of people with whom I share a deep connections with. And so I decided to start this series. Each mix in the series is crafted for a particualrly important person. I make them each for somone specific.
